In this lecture then what we’re going to explore is the point symmetry of different flowers.  In particular we have to gain practice in the way in which we examine the rotation and reflection lines that are found in objects.  More specifically we need to understand and recognise rotation points whether these be diad, triad, tetrad or hexad points.  And you also need to be able immediately write down the mathematical symbol for these types of operations.
Now let’s consider rotation in flowers a little more generally.  This slide shows five different flowers all of which have a different point symmetry. If we begin by looking in the flower at top left you can see it consists of two large petals and two small petals. Therefore if we want to rotate that flower and leave it unchanged in its aspect we would have to rotate through 90º.
This type of rotation or a diad rotation is shown as a lens; this is a formal representation of the 180º rotation in crystallography and symmetry.  Moving on to the next flower where we have three petals which are large and three which are small we have to rotate through 120º. This type of rotation is known as a triad rotation and illustrated by a triangular shape.
The next example is not a flower but a four-leaf clover as you know four-leaf clovers should bring you good luck.  In this case we need to rotate through 90º and the representation of this tetrad rotation is a square.  Next we have a flower with six petals so we have to rotate through increments of 60º so that the flower remains unchanged and the representation of the hexad rotation is the hexagonal symbol.
Of course as you know where you have rotation you sometimes have associated mirror lines and that is true in these examples.  Again if we start with the uppermost flower we find that there are two mirror lines, each mirror line is unique.  In the next example we can find three mirror lines but here every mirror is identical and each mirror passes through both a large and a small petal.
When we move to the four-leaf clover what we find are four mirror lines as shown.  One mirror line passes through the diagonal of the square, the other type passes through the face of the square.  And then for the flower with six petals we can find six mirror lines. But in this case there are two unique mirror lines, some pass through the centre of the petals, some pass between the petals.
I also just want to touch upon the flower at the bottom. Clearly it has five petals and to leave that flower unchanged in aspect through rotation you would have to have an increment of 72º.  And this could be shown as a pentagonal symbol. There are five mirror lines in this case but only one is unique or, another way of saying it, all five mirror lines are identical.
But there’s one proviso in this last example.  5-fold rotation is never used when we describe three dimensional symmetry or indeed any symmetry formally and that’s not found directly in crystallography. And I leave to you to think about why that might be so.  But towards the end of this course we will return to the question of why pentagonal symmetry is special.
So, now let’s define the point symmetry for all of these flowers.  In the first case, at the upper left side, you can see that we have two mirrors both unique plus the 2-fold rotation.  So, its point symmetry must be 2mm.  On the other hand if we move to the next flower we find that its point symmetry is 3m, 3-fold rotation but only one unique mirror.  It would not be described as 3mmm because every mirror is identical.
For the four-leaf clover the symmetry is 4mm, 4-fold rotation, two unique mirrors.  And finally for the last flower we see 6mm.  In this lecture we’ve learned that point symmetry only involves reflection and rotation.  Something that you have to be aware of and take care about is that the reflection or mirroring might be different.
So, we looked at flowers where we could find two mirror lines. One mirror line might be a pair of large petals, the other mirror line might be just involving the small petals.  But these mirrors were quite different and this takes some care.
You also learned how to assign the point symmetry symbol, recall the point symmetry symbol has three parts.  The first part is always the rotation point if present so we can take the value of one, two, three, four or six.  This is followed by the mirror lines.  If there are two types of mirror the symbol is mm.  If there is only one type the symbol is m.
