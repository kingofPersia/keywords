So far in this course, we have worked with one dimensional and two dimensional symmetry.  We’ve also looked at patterns and tiling.  These types of symmetry required mirror lines, and they also required rotation points.  For tiling, we also used translation, and when we combine translation with mirrors, then we created glide planes.  In this part of the course, we need to introduce one final concept, the idea of
chirality.  What we would like to do is have you understand the difference between a chiral and an achiral object, and also to be able to describe and explain the function of chirality.  The definition of chirality is very straightforward.  If you have two objects, one of which is the mirror of the other, and they are not superimposable, then you have a chiral object.  A good example are your hands.  Clearly, they are mirror
images of each other, but you cannot superimpose one upon the other.  A simple example of an achiral object would be a wine glass.  In the case of wine glasses, clearly we have a mirror relationship between them, but in this case, one can be superimposed upon the other.  So the definition of chirality is very straightforward, but it also turns out to the very, very important.
Chirality is also described in textbooks on chemistry.  Methane is composed of carbon surrounded by four hydrogens.  It’s in the shape of a tetrahedron, and we’ll talk about tetrahedra later in this course.  But it is possible to draw multiple mirror planes that intersect that molecule.  Therefore the molecule is said to be achiral, because its mirror image can superimpose upon the original object.
There are a series of molecules which can be used to illustrate chirality.  These are the so-called halogenated methanes.  In the halogenated methanes, we progressively take away one hydrogen and introduce a halogen.  The halogens are fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.  If we replace just one of the hydrogens by a halogen, say for example as in fluoromethane, we still have mirrors, therefore the molecule is still achiral.
If we were able to make a molecule containing two halogens, say fluorochloromethane, we still have a mirror.  But when we introduce three different halogens, for example fluorochlorobromomethane, then we destroy all the mirrors, and this is known as a chiral molecule.  This idea of having a carbon where each of the four species or entities around it are different, extends to very complicated molecules, and this is where the biological significance of chirality becomes especially important.  We are very fortunate today to have Professor Sabu Bankatraman [?], from the School of Material Science and Engineering at NTU to speak to us about this topic.  So we welcome you, Sabu, to talk to us today, and in particular to tell us about the troubles that turned about with thalidomide, when it was introduced many years ago.
So let’s just maybe take a quick look at the thalidomide molecule, and we have the two molecular forms in front of us here.  And we can see that they’re clearly chiral objects.  The molecules themselves have an aromatic part, they also have some oxygens and some nitrogens involved.  But there is clearly a mirror between these two forms, the R and the S form.  If we dissect the molecule, then you can see quite
clearly that there are four discrete entities bonded to that central chiral atom.  It’s because of that relationship, that geometric relationship between these entities, that all of the problems with thalidomide began.  With really needed to happen, however, was that these drugs would be separated, but it was not so easy to do that.  And I think you have some ideas about what went wrong in terms of separation and also how this might be improved or solved for future drugs.
Right.  Very good.  I think that we should also say that these – what we’re talking about here is the chemistry of the molecule as a standalone entity, and something that I would like to say is if we look at the textbooks, and we observe the molecule of thalidomide, it’s always shown as a plane, but in fact it’s not really a planar molecule.  The two parts have to rotate away from each other, otherwise we find that two of
the oxygen atoms are too close to each other.  So the story in the textbooks is correct, but it is somewhat simplified to the real case.  And later on in this course, when we come to look at crystals, and we look at molecular crystals, we will find the story is in fact even a little more complicated.  When thalidomide crystallises, it can do so in different ways.  These are the alpha and beta polymorphs of thalidomide, and this is something which we’ll discuss in part three of this course.
So thank you very much, Professor Sabu, we really appreciate your insights today, and I hope that you have learned something more about the importance of chirality in medicine.  So now you know what chirality is.  A chiral object is one which cannot be superimposed upon its mirror image.  In addition, chirality turns out to be tremendously in a lot of biological functions, and therefore and understanding of chirality is critical in biomedicine.  Shortly, we’ll start to introduce how we represent chirality mathematically, and in particular in symmetry diagrams.
