What we want to do now is move from two-dimensional or plane symmetry into three-dimensional symmetry and three-dimensional structures and in front of me here are two examples of polyhedron which make use of plane nets, which are then folded to create three-dimensional shapes

If we take as our first example this red polyhedron here… it’s known as a tetrahedron and – as you probably know – tetra means four

The tetra is referring not to the
number of corners on this shape but the number of faces

So, there are four faces with this tetrahedron

What’s important is that when you look at any particular face you can see it’s a triangle

So, intuitively you know that if you were to fold up a triangular net, you could create a tetrahedron

The other solid figure here is what’s known as an octahedron

In this case the octa, which is for
eight in Greek lexicon… the octa is referring to the eight faces

So, you’ve got four here at the top

You have four underneath

Actually in this case there are only six corners, but again if you have a look at this shape, you can see each face is a triangle

So, by folding the triangular net in a different way you can create an octahedron rather than a tetrahedron

The purpose, then, of this
lecture is to consider in detail, how do we develop these three-dimensional shapes from the two-dimensional networks

In particular we want to define the so-called Schläfli notation

The Schläfli notation provides us with a quantitative way in which we can define the solid figure by counting up the number of faces that surround each vertex

Historically there are five very important solid figures that are known as the Platonic solids and these
Platonic solids come up time and again in symmetry whether it be in architecture, in nature, or in crystallography, so it’s important that we understand the way in which these figures are constructed

There are of course many other solid shapes beyond these five Platonic solids and we can’t look at all of these in this course, but we will look at one, which is known as an Archimedean solid

It’s known as a cube octahedron

To create a tetrahedron from a
triangular network we select four adjacent triangles

The central triangle in the animation is shown in blue and the surrounding triangles in green and red and yellow make up the four faces of the tetrahedron

When these are folded together to create the solid figure we also create four vertices

It’s also possible to count the number of edges and for the tetrahedron there are six of these

The formal description of the tetrahedron is derived from counting the number of triangles around each vertex to derive the Schläfli notation symbol, which is 3

3

3 or 33

The tetrahedron can be viewed down its principal axis

If we look down the threefold axis, it’s represented by a triangle indicating threefold rotation and the associated mirror planes

We can also view the tetrahedron in such
a way that we view a single mirror or we can rotate so that we view a fourfold inversion axis

Fourfold inversion is something which we will cover in more detail in coming lectures, but it involves rotation of 90 degrees and then inversion through an inversion point

To construct an octahedron we again start with a triangular network, but in this case it requires eight triangles to
build the solid figure

These eight triangles of course create the eight faces that are observed

Once these are folded together we find that we have six vertices

In addition we can count the number of edges and for the octahedron there are 12 of these

Each vertex of the octahedron is surrounded by four triangles, so the Schläfli
symbol for the octahedron is 3

3

3

3 or – in shorthand – 34

To view the octahedron we select three principal directions

The direction which is easiest to visualise is looking down a fourfold rotation axis

As we know, every fourfold rotation axis is associated with mirror planes and these mirror planes will be of two
types: those that pass through the edges of the octahedron and those that pass through the corner

We can also rotate the octahedron to see twofold rotation and – in addition – threefold inversion

To construct a cube we begin with a square net rather than the triangular networks that we used for the tetrahedron and the octahedron

In this case we select six squares that will end up
forming the six faces when we fold it up into the three-dimensional body

After folding up the square faces we find that we end up with a solid that shows eight vertices and we can also count up the number of edges and there are 12 of these

The Schläfli symbol for the cube is 4

4

4 or 43, which is telling us that we have three
squares around every vertex

If we look at the cube down its fourfold rotation axis, we see the two types of mirror planes associated with that rotation

We can then rotate the cube to look down the body diagonal, which is shown as a threefold inversion axis

Finally we can look in across an edge of a cube and in this
case we end up with a twofold rotation axis; again associated with a mirror plane

Now we’ve looked in some detail at three of the Platonic solids: the tetrahedron, the octahedron, and the cube

There are two other Platonic solids

These are the icosahedron and the dodecahedron

The dodecahedron is a little bit different to those we’ve considered so far because it’s based on a pentagonal
network and in this case you join together these five-sided pentagons to create a figure with 20 vertices, 30 edges, and 12 faces

This is a fairly complicated figure and we won’t spend a lot of time on it in this course, but I think you’d agree it does look like quite a beautiful shape

The final Platonic solid is the icosahedron

In this case it is again made up of triangles, but there are a total of
20 triangular faces, so it’s much more complicated than, say, the octahedron, which only used six triangles

So, to summarise all the points that we’ve covered to date – and there are quite a number; the tetrahedron, the octahedron, the cube, the dodecahedron, and the icosahedron – we define these formally using the Schläfli symbols and remember the Schläfli symbols are derived by
counting the number of faces around each vertex

All the Platonic solids are composed of a combination of triangles only, squares only, or pentagons only

Because you use faces which are always the same shape, these are known as regular solids

You will notice that the way in which the names of the solids are derived is by counting the number of faces

So, in the simplest example – the
tetrahedron – you count up four of these faces

If you look in detail at the diagram of the top of this slide, you will see that all the vertices of the Platonic solids lie on the surface of spheres and that is also a property of these types of solids

Finally we’ll look at one example of an Archimedean solid

The Archimedean solids are
known as semi-regular solids

They’re semi-regular because they’re composed of faces of two types and in this case it’s a square face and a triangular face

The same principles apply however

We can take the plain net and fold it to create the three-dimensional solid, but in the case of the cube octahedron where you have surrounding each vertex two squares and two triangles – so, the
Schläfli symbol is 3

4

3

4 – we create a solid figure with 12 vertices, 24 edges, and 14 faces

In general the Platonic and the Archimedean solids obey the Euler rule, which states the sum of the edges and faces subtracted from the number of vertices will always equal two

So, to conclude this lecture, let’s recap everything that
we’ve learnt

Firstly, there are five regular polyhedra, which are known as the Platonic solids

These Platonic solids are the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, and dodecahedron

For the regular solids every face has the same shape: either a triangle or a square or a pentagon

There are also semi-regular shapes

In this
case you have two types of polygons making up the solid figure and the example that we looked at was an Archimedean solid known as a cube octahedron
